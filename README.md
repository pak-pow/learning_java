# Learning Java Journey ☕

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my journey of learning Java. This repo is organized by daily progress, containing code snippets, practice exercises, and notes.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This project is organized into folders, each representing a day of learning with specific focuses.

| Folder | Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[day1](/day1)** | Introduction & Syntax | Basic syntax, variables, data types, and "Hello World". |
| **[day2](/day2)** | Control Flow | Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`) and logic. |
| **[day3](/day3)** | Loops | Iteration using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. |
| **[day4](/day4)** | Arrays | Creating and manipulating arrays and collections. |
| **[day5](/day5)** | Methods | Defining functions, parameters, and return types. |
| **[day6](/day6)** | OOP Basics | Introduction to Classes, Objects, and Object-Oriented Programming. |

## 🛠️ Concepts Covered
- **Core Java**: Syntax, Variables, Operators
- **Control Structures**: Logic flow and Loops
- **Data Structures**: Arrays and Strings
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes and Objects

## 🚀 How to Run
To run the Java files in any of the folders, navigate to the directory and compile the specific file:

```bash
cd day1
javac Main.java
java Main
